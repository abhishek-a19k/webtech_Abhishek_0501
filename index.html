	My visit to DWIT / Participation in IT4D

â€“ Prof. Dr. Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry

I have been planning to visit Nepal since last 25 years. My this dream came true just this week by visiting Deerwalk Institute of Information Technology to participate in International event ICT4D . Now I feel that my visit was not only concerned to participate and contribute for the IT4D event but it remained exciting, adventurous, and rewarding.  The words become short to express my feelings. Fantastic experience of  Nepali smile and Namaste was noted everywhere.
