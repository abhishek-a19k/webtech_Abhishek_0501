	My visit to DWIT / Participation in IT4D

â€“ Prof. Dr. Bhawani Shankar Chowdhry

I have been planning to visit Nepal since last 25 years. My this dream came true just this week by visiting Deerwalk Institute of Information Technology to participate in International event ICT4D . Now I feel that my visit was not only concerned to participate and contribute for the IT4D event but it remained exciting, adventurous, and rewarding.  The words become short to express my feelings. Fantastic experience of  Nepali smile and Namaste was noted everywhere.

Of course, first and foremost objective of the visit was: to attend ICT4D event, to deliver my keynote, to share my success stories  in terms of academic collaboration and achievements to motivate participants and young faculty, to chair technical session, to get insight about research and development in the area of ICT in Nepal, to develop networking and so on.  Though, I visited more than 100  universities/Institutes of several countries like UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland,  Iceland, USA, Canada, Japan, Romania, Netherlands, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan, UAE in my 35 years of academic career, when Mr Ritu Raj Lamsal took me around DWIT,  and after having discussions with faculty and students, without any exaggeration I would like  to say that DWIT is a small beacon of excellence for imparting quality undergraduate education in the field of Computer  Science and Information System in Nepal. In my opinion, it is high time for DWIT to embark upon Masters program.
